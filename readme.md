# e-Commerce App

## Instructions
1. Run `npm i` in both the frontend and backend folders
2. When developing on localhost, do remember to run your frontend last since its port number is dynamically assigned based on available ports from 3000 onwards. Running the other services first will ensure that the port running the frontend is consistent with the code provided
3. Remember to ensure that nodemon.json is under the .gitignore to ensure your secrets information are not leaked.
